  """
  Classifies an image using a pre-trained model.

  This function takes a pre-trained Keras model and a preprocessed image 
  as input. It feeds the image through the model to obtain predictions, 
  then identifies the class with the highest predicted probability.

  Args:
    model (tf.keras.Model): The trained model used for classification.
    image (np.ndarray): A preprocessed image compatible with the model's input.

  Returns:
    str: The predicted class label for the image.

def format_image(image):

  Resizes an image for compatibility with the model.

  This function takes a PIL image object and resizes it to the dimensions 
  expected by the model for prediction.

  Args:

  Returns:
    PIL.Image: The resized image suitable for model input.
